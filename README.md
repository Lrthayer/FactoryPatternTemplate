# FactoryPatternTemplate
I was given a task recently that seemed perfect for the Factory Pattern, but when I tried to look up examples of the Factory Pattern for C++ none of them seemed all too great. So after I finished the task I figured I would make my own, knowing it's probably not any better than other sources at least it will be useful for me.
